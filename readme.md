Booking System
==============

This booking systems allows entertainment individuals or groups book shows

Typically, when an entertainment act books a show, they're locked in to this venue, and if they end up selling out the venue, that is it. They've sold out. When the entertainment's ticket sales exceeds the capacity of the venue, the entertainment is removed from the current vacancy and venue, and they move up to the vacancy and venue with a greater capacity that can handle their ticket sales. When this happens, the next best entertainment takes the previous entertainments spot. So, it is a constant readjusting of relationships between entertainment and vacancy/venue up until 48 hours before the vacancy. 48 hours before the vacancy, the booking is locked in regardless of the change in ticket sales. At this point, ticket sales are capped at the venues capacity. 

Benefits of this System
-----------------------

1. This system allows for more flexibility. This system adjusts in real-time. 

2. It allows the venues to ensure they are always booked. Venues begin booking on the lowest level first, meaning the venue with the smallest minimum ticket sale requirements will be booked first as the system comes online and entertainment begins to sell tickets. As tickets sell, the venues with larger minimum requirements for ticket sales and greater people capacity are filled as those who sell more tickets fill those capacities. This system fills venues from the bottom up, therefore this system prioritizes local organizations.

3. Each venue will be paired only with entertainment which match their type. If it is a music "act", this music "act" will only be paired with venues with the ability and infrastructure to support music "acts". If it's an art "act", this art "act" will only be paired with venues with the ability and infrastructure to support art "acts".

4. Venues that need it the most are booked first.

5. Venues vacancies are filled. There is no more space just sitting begin wasted. These assets can finally be maximized.

4. It ensures the entertainment is allowed to grow at the rate they can handle. No more venue capacity constraints. Entertainment are allowed to sell as many tickets as possible. If you sell 100 tickets, you will be performing at a venue with a capacity greater than or equal to 100. No more booking at a venue with a capacity of 100, selling 100 tickets and being stuck.

Main Components

ENTERTAINMENT
VENUE
VACANCY

(Please see issues for more information)



Venues want to maximize ENTERTAINMENT value (Musicians, Art, Comedy, "the creatives", etc.) ticket sales

The problem is when they book a "group" to perform,
a large portion of profit is based on how many tickets the "group" sells

VENUE ALCOHOL SALES
VENUE ENTRANCE FEE (MAYBE)
ENTERTAINMENT SALES (The higher this is, the better)

Objective: Sell more tickets
Constraint: Each venue has a capacity

The venues will set the available time slots that are vacant in their calendars

ENTERTAINMENT will automatically fill those vacancys
based on which "group" has sold the most tickets

ENTERTAINMENT is not locked into performing at THIS venue,
though they have made a commitment to show up and "perform"
If they sell more tickets than the capacity of the venue
EVEN AFTER having already booked the vacancy, they will
automatically move to the venue with the next greater capacity
and the band with the next highest number of ticket sales will take their place

This solution benefits the venues with the smallest requirements
and the smallest capacities first, and as local entertainment sells tickets,
they rise to level of their network, performance, entertainment values automatically.

To complicate this further, ENTERAINMENT'S TYPE MUST MATCH THE VENUES TYPE

So, venues will either have to always be paying attention to the ticket sales OR
We need a way for venues to communicate with each other and exchange bands in real-time


Vacancies are created by the venues
THE ENTERTAINMENT FIELD IS FLEXIBLE
If the ENTERTAINMENT sells more tickets than venue capacity
the ENTERTAINMENT moves to venue with next greater capacity

The vacancy must listen to ENTERTAINMENT ticket sales in real-time
If the ENTERTAINMENT sells more tickets than the vacancy can hold
The vacancy must scan all available ENTERTAINMENT
for the ENTERTAINMENT with the next highest number of ticket sales
